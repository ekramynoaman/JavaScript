		<p>Hello! My name is Tao Wei. I'm from China and have been living in the US for 6 years. Holding a bachelor degree in art history from Berkeley, I succussfully broke into the art world by working for a major auction house. But I realized that selling art to mega-rich people was not what I wanted. So I decided to change career and here I am, coming into Parsons to get my MFA in Design and Technology. I want to be a product designer for a major tech compan after graduation because it is fulfilling to participate in shaping the products of major tech companies that will potentially transform the society</p>
